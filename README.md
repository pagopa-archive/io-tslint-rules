# Italia TsLint tules

This package provides the following custom tslint rules for the Digital Citizenship
initiative:

* `no-tslint-disable-all`: Warns if you disable ALL tslint rules for a file or a line.
* `saga-yield-return-type`: Warns if a type assertion does not change the type of an expression.
